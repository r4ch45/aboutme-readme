# 👋 Howdy, I'm Rachel!

I'm a data and analytics leader working in the energy industry trying to do my bit for a cleaner future and a net-zero world.

I love taking a vague set of problems and turning them into tangible data use cases where statistics, code and visualisation can be used to add value. This normally involves answering key questions where the answer may come in any form - apps, maps, dashboards, conversations, database tables, models and beyond - and may need complex datasets combined with statistical analysis, machine learning and data visualisation to get there. I don’t mind what the solution is as long as we solve the problem. 

This ReadMe contains a short intro to hopefully give us a leg up when working together, it by no means replaces building our relationship but I hope it helps introduce you to some of my quirks up front! Props to Adnan Fiaz and Sam Young for the idea.

# 💰My Values
-	**Genuinity**: I spend ~2,000 hours/year at work and don’t have the brain space to compartmentalise myself. Sometimes that means wearing a silly t-shirt, making a bad joke, letting my hair go frizzy or telling you I’m tired. When other people show that too, it makes me feel more comfortable and trusted
- **Fail Fast**: I'm a big believer in Pareto - 20% effort takes you 80% of the way there. I think we learn most from experimentation and trying things out. I maybe also like Pareto because I'm not great at finishing things
-	**Empathy**: I like trying to see other’s viewpoint as I think it helps me be kinder and for us to work better together, I like it when people try and see my point of view and understand my feelings too

# 💪Strengths
- **Consensus**: I enjoy engaging with people and trying to ensure everyone is working towards the same goal. I'll really try to ensure you feel heard
- **Next Steps**: I like actions, and planned outcomes (it helps me feel like I'm accomplishing things). This means I'll often need to define outcomes and actions to be able to deliver work
- **Value Driven**: I may love data science but I don't mind if the answer to a problem is not data science, I'll do anything to try and help

# 😱Weaknesses
-	**Indirectness**: I worry a lot about hurting people’s feelings (I'm a bit of a people pleaser), and sometimes this means I “beat around the bush” in what I want to say which can lead to confusion or miscommunication. I need to learn to be clearer!
-	**Saying No**:  Part of the people pleasing side of me means I sometimes find it hard to say no, I always really want to help or accommodate people! Another thing I'm working on, I've found focussing on the output value on things helps me prioritise and makes saying no easier. :)
-   **Imposter Syndrome**: I often suffer from imposter syndrome, which means I worry about decisions I make or that my work isn't good enough. I'm working on this, but having someone to bounce my thinking off really helps me overthink less

# ❤️Preferences
- I like being able to finish up a thought before switching contexts, so appreciate a short heads up before a call if possible or I may seem groggy/distracted
- I like having written references, sometimes I struggle to remember conversations so following up with a note is always appreciated, or you may see me scribbling things down.
- Diagrams make more sense to me than words (although I do like words too!)
- I prefer informal messaging based communication instead of emails, I obsess over email wording too much
- I love feedback, if you have any I'd like to hear it as close to when you had the thought as possible, it helps me understand the context of things more

# 💬Conversation Starters
If you've made it this far and still want to converse with me, fantastic! Here are some things that are good conversation starters for me at the moment.
- Scottish roadtrips and adventures
- Football (soccer), I play for my local team and enjoy obsessing over my Fantasy Football team too
- **Favourite Book**: [Invisible Women by Caroline Criado Perez](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Invisible_Women:_Exposing_Data_Bias_in_a_World_Designed_for_Men), although I love Fantasy too like [The Fifth Season by N.K. Jemsin](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Fifth_Season_(novel)) (which made me realise I liked Fantasy) and [The Power by Naomi Alderman](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Power_(Alderman_novel))
- **Favourite Film**: [Fantastic Mr Fox directed by Wes Anderson](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fantastic_Mr._Fox_(film))
- **Favourite TV Series**: [I May Destroy You](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/I_May_Destroy_You), [Fleabag](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fleabag), [Master of None](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Master_of_None), although I have lots!
