# Howdy, I'm Rachel!

This document is a short intro to hopefully give us a leg up when working together, it by no means replaces building our relationship but I hope it helps introduce you to some of my quirks up front! Props to Adnan Fiaz and Sam Young for the idea.

# My Values
-	**Genuinity**: I spend ~2,000 hours/year at work and don’t have the brain space to compartmentalise myself. Sometimes that means wearing a silly t-shirt, making a bad joke, letting my hair go frizzy or telling you I’m tired. When other people show that too, it makes me feel more comfortable and trusted
- **Fail Fast**: I'm a big believer in Pareto - 20% effort takes you 80% of the way there. I think we learn most from experimentation and trying things out. I maybe also like Pareto because I'm not great at finishing things
-	**Empathy**: I like trying to see other’s viewpoint as I think it helps me be kinder and for us to work better together, I like it when people try and see my point of view and understand my feelings too


# Strengths

- **Consensus**: I enjoy engaging with people and trying to ensure everyone is working towards the same goal. I'll really try to ensure you feel heard
- **Next Steps**: I like actions, and planned outcomes (it helps me feel like I'm accomplishing things). This means I'll often need to define outcomes and actions to be able to deliver work
- **Value Driven** I may love data science but I don't mind if the answer to a problem is not data science, I'll do anything to try and help


# Weaknesses
-	**Indirectness**: I worry a lot about hurting people’s feelings (I'm a bit of a people pleaser), and sometimes this means I “beat around the bush” in what I want to say which can lead to confusion or miscommunication. I need to learn to be clearer!
-	**Context Switching**: I find it difficult swapping from one thing to another, if I'm quiet or dazed or confused, I'm probably still thinking about the last thing I was working on and taking a while to catch up, please be patient with me and provide additional context to help get me back up to speed
-   **Imposter Syndrome**: I often suffer from imposter syndrome, which means I worry about decisions I make or that my work isn't good enough. I'm working on this, but having someone to bounce my thinking off really helps me overthink less

# Preferences
- I like having written references, I struggle to remember conversations so following up with a note is always appreciated.
- Diagrams make more sense to me than words (although I do like words!)
- I like being able to finish up a thought before switching contexts, so appreciate a short heads up before a call if possible or I may seem groggy/distracted
- I prefer informal messaging based communication instead of emails, I obsess over email wording too much
- I love feedback, if you have any I'd like to hear it as close to when you had the thought as possible, it helps me understand the context of things more

# Conversation Starters
If you've made it this far and still want to converse with me, fantastic! Here are some things that are good conversation starters for me at the moment.
- Scottish roadtrips and adventures
- Football (soccer), I play for my local team and enjoy obsessing over my Fantasy Football team too
- **Favourite Book**: [Invisible Women by Caroline Criado Perez](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Invisible_Women:_Exposing_Data_Bias_in_a_World_Designed_for_Men)
- **Favourite Film**: [Fantastic Mr Fox directed by Wes Anderson](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fantastic_Mr._Fox_(film))
- **Favourite Series**: [Master of None](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Master_of_None), although I have lots!
