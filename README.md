# 👋 Howdy, I'm Rachel!

I'm a data scientists working in the energy industry trying to do my bit for a cleaner future and a net-zero world.

I love taking a vague set of problems and turning them into tangible data science use cases where statistics, code and visualisation can be used to add value. This normally involves answering key questions where the answer may come in any form - apps, maps, dashboards, conversations, database tables, models and beyond - and may need complex datasets combined with statistical analysis, machine learning and data visualisation to get there. I don’t mind what the solution is as long as we solve the problem. 

This ReadMe contains a short intro to hopefully give us a leg up when working together, it by no means replaces building our relationship but I hope it helps introduce you to some of my quirks up front! Props to Adnan Fiaz and Sam Young for the idea.

# My Values
-	**Genuinity**: I spend ~2,000 hours/year at work and don’t have the brain space to compartmentalise myself. Sometimes that means wearing a silly t-shirt, making a bad joke, letting my hair go frizzy or telling you I’m tired. When other people show that too, it makes me feel more comfortable and trusted
- **Fail Fast**: I'm a big believer in Pareto - 20% effort takes you 80% of the way there. I think we learn most from experimentation and trying things out. I maybe also like Pareto because I'm not great at finishing things
-	**Empathy**: I like trying to see other’s viewpoint as I think it helps me be kinder and for us to work better together, I like it when people try and see my point of view and understand my feelings too


I'm a PhD student working within the Energy Systems & AI Lab at the UCL Energy Institute, my research focuses on new techniques for forecasting electricity prices and wind power to aid in optimisation of wind farm operation. Before starting my PhD I received a bachelors in Chemical Engineering and masters in Energy Systems & Data Analytics. Alongside my research I help teach statistics, programming, and GIS to masters students at the UCL Energy Institute. 

* 🎓 PhD student at the UCL Energy & AI Lab 
* ⚡ Organiser, participant, and winner of energy hackathons
* 💻 Freelance data scientist, data visualiser, and web-developer
* 💬 Normally talking about something energy or Python related


# Strengths

- **Consensus**: I enjoy engaging with people and trying to ensure everyone is working towards the same goal. I'll really try to ensure you feel heard
- **Next Steps**: I like actions, and planned outcomes (it helps me feel like I'm accomplishing things). This means I'll often need to define outcomes and actions to be able to deliver work
- **Value Driven**: I may love data science but I don't mind if the answer to a problem is not data science, I'll do anything to try and help


# Weaknesses
-	**Indirectness**: I worry a lot about hurting people’s feelings (I'm a bit of a people pleaser), and sometimes this means I “beat around the bush” in what I want to say which can lead to confusion or miscommunication. I need to learn to be clearer!
-	**Context Switching**: I find it difficult swapping from one thing to another, if I'm quiet or dazed or confused, I'm probably still thinking about the last thing I was working on and taking a while to catch up, please be patient with me and provide additional context to help get me back up to speed
-   **Imposter Syndrome**: I often suffer from imposter syndrome, which means I worry about decisions I make or that my work isn't good enough. I'm working on this, but having someone to bounce my thinking off really helps me overthink less

# Preferences
- I like having written references, I struggle to remember conversations so following up with a note is always appreciated.
- Diagrams make more sense to me than words (although I do like words!)
- I like being able to finish up a thought before switching contexts, so appreciate a short heads up before a call if possible or I may seem groggy/distracted
- I prefer informal messaging based communication instead of emails, I obsess over email wording too much
- I love feedback, if you have any I'd like to hear it as close to when you had the thought as possible, it helps me understand the context of things more

# Conversation Starters
If you've made it this far and still want to converse with me, fantastic! Here are some things that are good conversation starters for me at the moment.
- Scottish roadtrips and adventures
- Football (soccer), I play for my local team and enjoy obsessing over my Fantasy Football team too
- **Favourite Book**: [Invisible Women by Caroline Criado Perez](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Invisible_Women:_Exposing_Data_Bias_in_a_World_Designed_for_Men), although I love Fantasy too like [The Fifth Season by N.K. Jemsin](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Fifth_Season_(novel)) (which made me realise I liked Fantasy) and [The Power by Naomi Alderman](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Power_(Alderman_novel))
- **Favourite Film**: [Fantastic Mr Fox directed by Wes Anderson](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fantastic_Mr._Fox_(film))
- **Favourite TV Series**: [I May Destroy You](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/I_May_Destroy_You), [Fleabag](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fleabag), [Master of None](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Master_of_None), although I have lots!
